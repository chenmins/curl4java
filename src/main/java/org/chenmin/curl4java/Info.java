 * TIMES
 * 
 * An overview of the six time values available from curl_easy_getinfo()
 * 
 * curl_easy_perform()   |   |--NAMELOOKUP   |--|--CONNECT   |--|--|--APPCONNECT   |--|--|--|--PRETRANSFER   |--|--|--|--|--STARTTRANSFER   |--|--|--|--|--|--TOTAL   |--|--|--|--|--|--REDIRECT
 * 
 * NAMELOOKUP
 * 
 * CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME. The time it took from the start until the name resolving was completed.
 * 
 * CONNECT
 * 
 * CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME. The time it took from the start until the connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
 * 
 * APPCONNECT
 * 
 * CURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME. The time it took from the start until the SSL connect/handshake with the remote host was completed. (Added in in 7.19.0)
 * 
 * PRETRANSFER
 * 
 * CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME. The time it took from the start until the file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
 * 
 * STARTTRANSFER
 * 
 * CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME. The time it took from the start until the first byte is received by libcurl.
 * 
 * TOTAL
 * 
 * CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME. Total time of the previous request.
 * 
 * REDIRECT
 * 
 * CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME. The time it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before final transaction was started. So, this is zero if no redirection took place.
